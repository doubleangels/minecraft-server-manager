# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving Minecraft Server Manager. This project is a server-rendered
Node.js app with a minimal build step (Tailwind CSS plus an esbuild client-JS bundle), so the
barrier to hacking on it is low.

## Getting set up

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev        # starts the app with auto-restart + Tailwind CSS watch
```

`pnpm run dev` serves the browser JS straight from `public/js/`. `pnpm run build:js` produces the
minified esbuild bundle in `public/dist/` (a gitignored artifact); the app serves it when present
and falls back to raw source otherwise, so you only need it to test the production bundle.

Open http://localhost:25564. You need **Node.js 24+** (for the flagless built-in `node:sqlite`) and
Docker running to exercise anything that touches containers. First run creates the admin account.

All state lives under `./data` (or `$DATA_DIR`). To start from a clean slate, stop the app and delete
that directory; it's rebuilt on boot.

## Optional: CodeGraph indexing

This repo works well with CodeGraph, which builds a local symbol/call-graph index for faster code
navigation and better AI-assisted edits. It's entirely optional and per-developer: install the
CodeGraph CLI, run its daemon at the repo root, and it maintains a `.codegraph/` directory. That
directory is gitignored (a large, machine-local SQLite index plus a daemon socket and PID file) and
each developer's daemon rebuilds it, so there's nothing to commit or share.

## Before you open a PR

These are the exact gates CI runs. Each works on a clean clone with no Docker or running app:

```bash
pnpm run lint          # ESLint (errors, no warnings)
pnpm run format:check  # Prettier
pnpm run typecheck     # tsc --checkJs over the type-clean core
pnpm test              # unit tests (node:test)
pnpm run build         # Tailwind CSS + esbuild client-JS bundle
```

`pnpm run format` fixes formatting. `pnpm test` is a real, fast unit suite (no Docker); `pnpm run
test:smoke` is the separate live sweep against a running panel. While iterating on a change, `pnpm run
test:watch` re-runs the suite on every save.

`main` is protected: the CI status check `quality` is required. It is an aggregate job that is green
only when the `checks` job (lint, format, typecheck, build), the `tests` job, and the PR-only
`docker-build` job all pass. The PR branch must be up to date with `main`, and direct pushes, force
pushes and deletion are blocked for everyone including admins. Every change (releases too) lands
through a PR. The same workflow publishes the `:latest` image and the GitHub Release on a push to
`main`, and those jobs only run after the gates pass, so an untested commit can never ship.

Keep changes focused and match the surrounding style (Prettier enforces it). Server code is **plain
CommonJS JS, with no TypeScript compile step**. The browser code in `public/js/` is ESM, bundled and
minified by **esbuild** into `public/dist/js/` for production; it is not a framework and not a build
prerequisite for development, so keep it hand-written progressive enhancement. Type safety comes
from JSDoc + a `tsc --checkJs` gate: `types/globals.d.ts` holds ambient augmentations, and dynamic
interop files (Docker/NBT/HTTP-JSON) carry a `// @ts-nocheck` header while type coverage is grown
incrementally; new modules are checked by default, so keep them clean.

`public/vendor/chart.umd.js` is a **vendored** copy of Chart.js (not a package dependency); update it by
hand and note the version in the PR.

## How the code is organized

The full picture is in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md). The short version:

**Layering, one direction only:**

```
web/routes (HTTP)  →  services (domain logic)  →  docker / db / storage (infrastructure)
```

- **`web/routes/`**: Express routers. Parse/validate input (zod), call a service, shape the
  response. No business logic here.
- **`services/`**: the domain logic. This is where features live. Services may call `docker/`,
  `db/`, `storage/`, and each other.
- **`docker/`, `db/`, `storage/`**: infrastructure. `docker/` wraps dockerode; `db/` wraps
  `node:sqlite` + migrations; `storage/` owns the `./data` layout, the path guard, and disk quotas.
- **`config/field-catalog/`** is the **single source of truth** for server settings: every itzg
  environment variable, its friendly label, help text, type, default, and validation. Add a server
  setting here and the wizard/forms/validation pick it up automatically.
- **`events/`** and **`ws/`** are cross-cutting: `recordEvent()` is the one entry point for history,
  and `ws/` carries the live console + stats sockets.

## Two conventions that will surprise you

1. **Never touch the filesystem under `./data` directly.** Always resolve paths through the path
   guard in `src/storage/` (`safeJoin`). It rejects any path that escapes the data root, which is the
   backbone of the app's file-safety story. Uploads and archive extraction are additionally
   size-capped.
2. **Lazy `require()` calls are intentional cycle-breakers.** Some modules `require()` a sibling
   _inside a function_ rather than at the top of the file to avoid a circular dependency at load
   time. If you see `const x = require('...')` mid-function, that's why; don't "clean it up" by
   hoisting it without checking for the cycle.
3. **`server.properties` is a single-writer file.** The itzg image re-asserts environment-backed
   properties on every start, so any code that changes a property directly must go through
   `writeServerProperties()` (whole file) or `setServerProperty()` (one key) in
   `src/services/servers.js`, which atomically rewrite the file and un-set the matching env var.
   Never a raw `fs.writeFile` plus a separate env edit. World Controls (PvP / difficulty), the
   whitelist toggle, and the Files editor already use them. Property-backed env fields carry a
   `prop:` attribute in `src/config/field-catalog/`; the field-catalog tests check every `prop`
   against a vendored copy of the image's own `property-definitions.json`
   (`test/fixtures/itzg-property-definitions.json`), so a field the image maps to a property but the
   catalog does not is a test failure. Refresh the fixture from upstream when adding one.

## Shared helpers

Prefer the shared helpers over re-implementing patterns:

- `src/utils/httpError.js`: `httpError(status, message)` for throwing HTTP errors from services.
- `src/web/middleware/jsonErrorHandler.js`: the standard JSON error handler (redacts 5xx detail).
- `src/web/middleware/asyncHandler.js`: wraps async route handlers so rejections reach the error
  handler. Prefer it over hand-written `try/catch → next(err)`.
- Embedding JSON for the browser to `JSON.parse`: `{{jsonScript x}}` inside `<script>` text (an
  `application/json` island or an inline object literal) and `{{jsonAttr x}}` inside a quoted
  `data-*` attribute. Both return a SafeString, so the brace count does not matter; the helper name
  carries the context. `test/template-json.test.js` fails a helper used in the wrong place.

## User-facing copy

Anything a person reads in the panel (button labels, headings, help text, empty
states, toasts, validation and error messages, and the docs) follows one house
style so the product reads as friendly to both technical and non-technical
users:

- **Casing:** Title Case for buttons and for short selectable choices (dropdown
  options, radio and checkbox labels, tabs, overflow-menu items, toggle chips).
  The `page-header heading=` stays ALL CAPS. `<h2>` / `<h3>` section and card
  headings, table `<th>`, and non-progress `openModal` titles are Title Case
  too. Everything else (help, hints, tooltips, placeholders, empty-state bodies,
  toasts, confirm-dialog bodies and titles, event and history summaries) is a
  full sentence in sentence case.
- **Terminal punctuation:** every sentence-shaped string ends in `.`, `!`, or
  `?`. Bare fragments, single-word labels, and short example placeholders do
  not.
- **History summaries:** every `recordEvent({ summary })` string ends in a
  period, including the terse `Label: detail` lines ("Folder created:
  plugins/x.jar.", "Server restarted.").
- **In-progress status lines end in `…`, never a period**: `runTask` /
  progress modal titles and every `task.step(...)` / `onProgress(...)` /
  `onStep(...)` label, as sentence-case gerunds ("Creating backup…",
  "Querying Modrinth, CurseForge, …"). A step that reports an outcome rather
  than an ongoing action is a sentence and takes a period ("Shrink skipped
  because the server was running.").
- **No `" - "` as a sentence dash, and no `–` or `—`.** Split into two
  sentences, use a colon, or a parenthetical. Hyphenated compounds are fine.
- **Proper nouns stay capitalised:** Minecraft, Mojang, Docker, Java, RCON,
  Modrinth, CurseForge, BlueMap, Discord, Fabric/Forge/NeoForge/Quilt/Paper/
  Purpur, Bedrock, Geyser, Node.js, pnpm. Capitalise an interpolated
  `${loader}` through the `capitalize()` helper.
- **No infrastructure jargon in user text:** "rebuild the server" not
  "recreate", "the data folder" not `./data`, "stopped for running out of
  memory" not "OOM-killed".
- **Errors** are friendly and actionable, never a bare status code, a raw
  `err.message`, raw Zod text, or an internal id. Client code has
  `friendlyError(res | err, { action })` in
  [`public/js/lib/errors.js`](public/js/lib/errors.js) for API-call fallbacks.
- The field catalog (`src/config/field-catalog/`) uses curly `'` apostrophes
  internally and consistently; leave those as-is. Straight quotes everywhere
  else.

### What the copy check covers

`pnpm run test:prose` enforces all of the above mechanically, and it reads every place text
reaches a person:

- **Views:** headings, table headers, buttons, options, tabs, legends, captions, chips, checkbox
  and radio labels, list items, paragraphs, help text, every partial parameter in either quote
  style (`title=`, `sub=`, `message=`, `ctaLabel=`, …), the attributes a person reads or hears
  (`title`, `data-tip`, `data-th`, `placeholder`, `aria-label`, `alt`, `data-desc`, …), the quoted
  arguments of `default` and `plural`, and inline `<script>` blocks.
- **JavaScript** (`src/` and `public/js/`): toasts, errors, validation messages, progress and
  history strings, log lines, and the string properties and arrays that carry copy. HTML built in a
  string or template (`innerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML`) is read with the same rules as a view.
- **Everything else prose-shaped:** a string of four or more words that no context above claims
  still gets the dash, quote, jargon, and proper-noun rules, and must end in a period if it holds a
  full stop mid-string. A new property or helper name cannot hide copy from the check.
- **Docs and other text:** every Markdown file (the newest `CHANGELOG.md` section only, since old
  release notes are a record of what shipped), `public/manifest.json`, the `package.json`
  description, and the GitHub issue forms.

A few things are deliberately judged more loosely. Placeholders and screen-reader labels
(`aria-label`, `alt`) are fragments, so they need a capital letter but no period, and a placeholder
that is an example (a host name, a URL, anything in a monospace field) is not checked at all. A
checkbox label longer than six words is a sentence, so it is not forced into Title Case. A disabled
option or an option that reads as a status line ("Loading biomes…") is a message, not a choice.
A field-catalog switch (a `boolean` field) is a choice, so its label is Title Case; the catalog's other captions stay sentence case. Prompts sent to a language model
(`src/services/wizard*.js`) are not user copy.

## Logging

Server code logs through `src/logger.js`, never `console.*` (ESLint enforces this under `src/`; only
`preflight.js`, `instrument.js`, and `config/index.js` run before the logger exists and are exempt).
At the top of a module:

```js
const logger = require('../logger')(require('node:path').basename(__filename));
```

- **Message string:** one plain sentence, sentence case, ending in `.`, `!`, or `?`, with **no
  colon**. Every variable goes in the structured second argument, not interpolated into the text;
  `logger.info('Started a server.', { serverId, actor })`, not ``logger.info(`Started server ${id}`)``.
- **Levels:** `info` = start/finish of a state-changing operation; `debug` = rejected input, early
  returns, intermediate steps, high-frequency read paths; `warn` = recoverable failure; `error` =
  a failure carrying a stack (pair it with `captureError(err, …)` from `src/instrument.js`); `fatal`
  = the process is going down.
- **One owner per error.** A `catch` that rethrows or calls `next(err)` does not log; the error
  handler owns it. A `catch` that swallows and handles locally logs exactly once.
- **Secrets:** `src/utils/logSanitize.js` redacts secret-shaped keys and strips URL query strings,
  but don't hand the logger request bodies, passwords, tokens, or full entity lists; pass ids and
  counts. In hot loop bodies pass primitives only.
- High-frequency background loops use `makeFailureThrottle()` from `src/logger.js` so a persistent
  failure logs once, not every tick.

## The installer

`deploy/install.sh` is the one path every host and provider deployment should use, so it has its own
tests rather than being smoke-tested by hand:

```bash
node --test test/deploy-install.test.js   # pure helpers, no Docker, runs anywhere
pnpm run test:deploy                      # install/upgrade/uninstall in a container, docker mocked
pnpm run test:deploy:real                 # the heavy one: real Docker, real image, real panel
```

The script keeps its logic in functions and only runs `main` when executed, so the unit test can
source it and call pieces directly. Anything you add to it wants a scenario in
`test/deploy/install-scenarios.sh`.

## Reporting bugs / requesting features

Open an issue with clear reproduction steps (and your OS + Docker flavor for anything
environment-specific); the issue forms ask for the details that save a round trip. Not sure it's a
bug? [`SUPPORT.md`](SUPPORT.md) covers where to ask.

Security issues go through [private reporting](https://github.com/anefzaoui/minecraft-server-manager/security/advisories/new)
rather than a public issue. [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) explains what to include and what happens
next.

## Getting your face on the README

The avatar strip near the top of the README is `docs/images/contributors.svg`, generated from the
repository's contributor list by `scripts/contributors-svg.js`. Land one commit and you're in it:
a workflow regenerates the strip on the first of each month and opens a PR when it changes, and you
can refresh it yourself any time with `pnpm run contributors`.

The avatars are baked into that one file, so the README never asks a third-party image service for
anything.

Below it sits a second strip, `docs/images/contributors-reports.svg`, for people whose bug report,
reproduction, or idea shipped without a commit behind it. GitHub's contributor list only counts
commits and cannot know that, so those logins live in [`docs/credits.json`](docs/credits.json) and
the same script draws them. Add a login there and run `pnpm run contributors`. Anyone who later
lands a commit drops out of that strip automatically and turns up in the main one.
