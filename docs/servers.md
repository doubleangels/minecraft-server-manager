# Creating & managing servers

[← Back to docs index](README.md)

## Creating a server

Click **New Server** (top bar) or the **Create a server** card to open the wizard.

![Create a server](images/create-wizard.png)

You choose:

- A **name** (and optional icon, accent color, and tags to organize your fleet).
- A **server type** - vanilla, Paper, Fabric, Forge, NeoForge, and more, each mapped to the right itzg image behind the scenes.
- A **Minecraft version** - `LATEST`, a snapshot, or a specific version.
- **Resources** - RAM (heap), container memory limit, CPU, and a disk quota.

Prefer a modpack? The **From modpack** tab installs a CurseForge, Modrinth, FTB, or GT New Horizons pack instead - see [Modpacks](modpacks.md) - or takes a **custom zip you upload**: a CurseForge modpack export (`manifest.json`) or any zip of mod jars. The manifest (or a majority vote across the identified jars) fills in the loader and Minecraft version, and every mod installs in one task. You can also start from a saved [Blueprint](blueprints.md).

The panel picks a sensible Java runtime for your version automatically, pulls the image, creates the container, and (optionally) starts it - all from the one form.

## The servers list

The **Servers** page lists your whole fleet with status and quick stats.

## A single server

![Players](images/players.png)

Opening a server gives you a tabbed workspace:

- **Overview** - status, live stats, uptime, and the primary start / stop / restart controls.
- **Console** - the live log stream and command input, plus in-game chat ([details](console-and-chat.md)).
- **Players** - who's online, plus inventory, analytics, and [chat commands](console-and-chat.md).
- **World** - [worlds, mods, the live map, and the file manager](worlds-and-files.md).
- **Backups** - [snapshots and restore](backups.md) for this server.
- **Insights** - metrics and per-server history, including crash reports (see below).
- **Settings** - everything about how the server runs.

## Server settings

The **Settings** tab is the full configuration surface: rename, resources, update policy, auto-start / auto-restart, environment variables, and advanced Docker overrides. Fields that change how the container runs are clearly marked as needing a restart.

> Advanced Docker override fields (custom container name, extra port and bind mounts, and raw overrides) are **admin-only**, because a bind mount plus the panel's Docker access is effectively root on the host. See [Users & roles](users-and-roles.md).

## Crash reports & mclo.gs analysis

Crash reports (`crash-reports/*.txt` and JVM `hs_err_pid*.log` files) are picked up automatically, parsed into a one-line summary with the exception and suspected mods, and listed under **Insights → History**:

![Crash report card](images/crash-mclogs-card.png)

Each report card offers a built-in viewer (with collapsible sections and highlighted exceptions), copy-stack-trace, download - and two [mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs) actions:

- **Share to mclo.gs** publishes the report as a public paste and copies the link - the exact thing mod authors and support Discords ask for. The link is remembered on the report, so nothing is ever uploaded twice.
- **Analyze** runs mclo.gs's automated insights over the paste: known problems with suggested fixes (missing dependencies, version mismatches, common mod conflicts), rendered right in the panel.

Both actions sit behind an explicit confirmation, because a paste is public: crash reports can include player names and your full mod list. The panel never uploads anything on its own.
