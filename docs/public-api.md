# Public API

[← Back to docs index](README.md)

A small, read-only HTTP API for fetching server status from outside the panel: a
status dashboard, an uptime monitor, a Discord bot, a home-automation rule. It is
served by the panel itself and returns the same live data the panel's own pages
show (from the in-memory cache), so polling it never touches Docker.

It is **off until an admin uses it** and **admin-gated**. Nothing is exposed
until a token exists.

## Enabling it

**Settings → Public API → New Key**. Give it a name, choose what it can see (all
servers, or a specific subset), and optionally an expiry date. The full key (a
Bearer token) is shown **once**, in a dialog; copy it now, because only a short prefix
is kept afterwards, for identification in the list.

Creating the first key turns the API on automatically (the **Let outside apps
read status** switch is a pause control: turn it off to stop serving without
cancelling any keys). Cancel a key from the same table at any time; clients using it lose
access immediately.

Tokens are stored as a SHA-256 hash (never in plaintext), survive a panel
restart, and outlive the servers they are scoped to (a deleted server simply
drops out of that token's results).

## Authenticating

Send the token as a Bearer credential:

```
Authorization: Bearer msm_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

There are no cookies and **no CORS**: this is for server-to-server and CLI
callers, not browser apps on another origin. If the panel is behind a reverse
proxy, make sure the proxy forwards the `Authorization` header.

Failures return `401` with `{ "ok": false, "error": "..." }`. Anything other than `GET`
(or `HEAD`) returns `405`. Unknown paths return `404`. When the API is disabled, every route
returns `404`.

## Rate limit

Each token gets its own budget, `RATE_LIMIT_PUBLIC_API_PER_MIN` (default `120`
requests/minute; `0` disables the limiter). Over the limit returns `429`. Requests that
never present a valid token (missing, malformed, revoked, or expired) are capped separately
per client IP at five times that number, so probing cannot bypass the budget by rotating
tokens.

## Caching

Every successful (`200`) response carries `Cache-Control: private, max-age=5` and
`Vary: Authorization`, and an `ETag`. The data only refreshes every few seconds, so a
client or dashboard can reuse a response for five seconds, or send `If-None-Match` and
get a cheap `304`. Errors (`400`, `401`, `404`, `429`) are never cacheable. Polling more
often than every five seconds gains nothing and spends your rate limit.

## Endpoints

### `GET /api/v1/servers`

Every server the token is scoped to.

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "total": 1,
  "online": 1,
  "servers": [
    {
      "id": "srv_ab12cd34",
      "name": "SMP",
      "type": "PAPER",
      "state": "running",
      "cpuPct": 18.4,
      "memoryMb": 2048,
      "memoryLimitMb": 4096,
      "uptimeSeconds": 11722,
      "players": { "online": 3, "max": 20 }
    }
  ]
}
```

### `GET /api/v1/servers/:id`

One server, same object under a `server` key. Returns `404` for an unknown id
**and** for a server the token is not scoped to (no existence oracle), and `400`
for a malformed id.

### `GET /api/v1/servers/:id/players`

Who is online right now, plus recent play sessions (newest first).
`?limit=` sets how many sessions come back (1 to 200, default 50).

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "online": 2,
  "max": 20,
  "names": ["Alex", "Steve"],
  "sessions": [{ "player": "Steve", "startedAt": "2026-03-02T10:00:00.000Z", "endedAt": null, "open": true }]
}
```

`online`, `max`, and `names` are `null` until the server has reported a player
list. Only player names are exposed, never UUIDs or IP addresses.

### `GET /api/v1/servers/:id/backups`

Backup history, newest first, with `id`, `filename`, `sizeBytes`, `reason`
(`manual`, `scheduled`, `pre-update`, or `pre-restore`), `note`, and `createdAt`.
`?limit=` works the same as above. File paths and checksums are not exposed.

Both routes return `404` for an unknown id **and** for a server the token is not
scoped to, and `400` for a malformed id or limit.

### `GET /api/v1/metrics`

The same live data in Prometheus text format, for Grafana, Uptime Kuma, and
other scrapers. It uses the same token, scope filter, and rate limit as the JSON
routes, and it never touches Docker. A reading the server has not reported (for
example TPS on a server type that does not expose it) is left out rather than
reported as zero.

| Metric                          | Meaning                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `msm_servers`                   | How many servers are visible to this token.            |
| `msm_server_up`                 | `1` when the server is running, otherwise `0`.         |
| `msm_server_cpu_percent`        | Recent CPU use as a percent of one core.               |
| `msm_server_memory_bytes`       | Memory in use.                                         |
| `msm_server_memory_limit_bytes` | Configured container memory limit.                     |
| `msm_server_uptime_seconds`     | Seconds since the container started.                   |
| `msm_server_players_online`     | Players currently online.                              |
| `msm_server_players_max`        | Player slots.                                          |
| `msm_server_tps`                | Ticks per second over the last minute, where reported. |
| `msm_server_mspt`               | Mean milliseconds per tick, where reported.            |

Per-server metrics carry `server_id` and `name` labels. A Prometheus scrape job:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: minecraft
    metrics_path: /api/v1/metrics
    authorization:
      credentials: msm_your_token_here
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['panel.example.com']
```
